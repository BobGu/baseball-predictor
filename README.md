# Baseball predictor

###### Hello!  This is a repo that uses tensorflow's learn API.  We will use the tensorflow learn library to predict the following...
 * Predict wether someone will hit more or less than 55 RBIs
 * Predict if someone has more or less than 17 Stolen Bases(SB)
 * Predict a players position

### Build
* To run this project you are going to need (python)[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/]
* If you have python you probably already have pip, which is the package management system for python
* To get the required packages for this project run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, if you have python3 use `pip3 instead`
